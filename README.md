# Path to Singularity

Simulate a dying star. Tap the star to collect its energy, use energy to buy upgrades so you can collect even more energy. Buy bigger, more powerful stars. Some stars will go supernova, some will turn into white dwarves, but in the end, you know you've made it when your star becomes the singularity. Embark on your journey to create a black hole!
